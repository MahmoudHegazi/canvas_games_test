##### canvasEvents Come with on event item drag start based on javascript other mouse related html element events to accurate events like it generated by js event listener itself (for cavnas reacts and shape)

as we can see first on drag start fired, and then drag event keep firing while user hold the shape/mouse and keep moving the mouse, and finally on drag relase that end both on drag start and on drag evens fired one time at end (due to work async with js/jquery events)
